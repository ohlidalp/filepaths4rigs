Character sets/encodings of filesystem paths are a shady area. Even C++17 filesystem library will just tell you "[it's OS-dependent/unspecified/`${OTHER_EXCUSE}`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path/string)".

This project is my research testbed. It's named "\*4rigs" after my pet-project [Rigs of Rods](https://github.com/only-a-ptr/rigs-of-rods).
